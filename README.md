# Statistical Modelling Homeworks
A collection of homeworks done for the Statistical Modelling course at UZH in Fall Semester 2023.

From course catalogue:
After a brief introduction to linear regression analysis, this module provides an overview of the most 
important statistical models in political science and their relationship to various types of outcome variables. 
The focus is on practical experience with programming the models in R as well as interpreting and communicating 
the results. The models can include those for categorical data, limited dependent variables, event counts and 
durations, complex data structures (e.g. panel data) and systems of equations.
